							<p>In this project I worked on building a self-driving taxi. As the name suggests, the purpose of the taxi was to autonomously navigate a multi-routed track, recognize traffic signs and taxi passengers
								from pick-up to drop-off locations using the 2D coordinates of which were communicated wirelessly</p>
							<p>As you can imagine, the project was was not a straight foward one as I had to learn by doing.I used a convolutional neural network to teach the car to steer itself on the track. I obtained my training data by using the camera frames from the raspberry pi camera as input and the steering angle of the rc car as output.
								Details of the project including the code can be found here.
